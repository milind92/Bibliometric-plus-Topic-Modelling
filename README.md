# Bibliometric-plus-Topic-Modelling

This repository contains experiments on bibliometric analysis, topic modelling
and knowledge graph generation. The notebooks and scripts illustrate different
approaches for processing research papers.

## New: `colab_pdf_topic_kg.py`

`colab_pdf_topic_kg.py` is a minimal example designed for Google Colab. It lets
you upload PDF articles, perform LDA topic modelling and build a simple
knowledge graph from named entities. The resulting graph is visualised with
pyvis.

Run it in Colab cell by cell or as a standalone script after installing the
required packages.
